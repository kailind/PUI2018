    <p>Four conversation about gun violence</p>
    

    <!--Here is a single row with a 4/8 column split in Bootstrap-->
    <div class="row">
      <p>Laws got passed and removed, solutions got proposed and shelved. However, the issue of gun violence only worsened. There has always been a tug-of-war about the gun control issue. The gun advocates argue that guns don’t kill people, people kill people. Guns can be used in self-defense. The gun critics, on the other hand, argue that guns only increases crime rate and promotes more violence. Following Ira Glass’s four interviews from This American Life, we witness the tug-of-war between the pro-gun team and the anti-gun team. Who will win this tug-of-war? Or, will anyone win?</p>
